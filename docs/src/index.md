# OpenFactCheck Documentation

```{eval-rst}
.. module:: openfactcheck
```

OpenFactCheck is an open source, library designed to facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of factuality in responses generated by large language models (LLMs).

The design of {mod}`openfactcheck` emphasizes two principles:

- Customizability and extensibility for both users and developers
- Compatibility with existing methods and datasets

It consists of three core modules:

```{gallery-grid}
:grid-columns: 1 1 2 3

- header: "{fas}`check-to-slot;pst-color-primary`  Response Evaluator"
  content: "Customizes an automatic fact-checker to verify free-form documents, providing detailed reports on the factuality of the responses."
- header: "{fas}`chart-line;pst-color-primary`  LLM Evaluator"
  content: "Applies factuality-specific benchmarks to assess the factual performance of large language models, providing detailed reports on the factuality of the responses."
- header: "{fas}`trophy;pst-color-primary`  Fact Checker Evaluator"
  content: "Evaluates fact-checking accuracy, featuring a leaderboard that ranks systems by precision, speed, and cost, driving innovation in automatic fact-checking."
```

Explore the documentation to learn more about the library, its features, how to use and contribute to it, and more.
