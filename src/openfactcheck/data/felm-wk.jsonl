At the individual unit level, the price might not be an issue, but the Russian economy possibly cannot support the mass production of the state-of-the-art fighter.\n\n2. Engine Issues: The Su-57 initially used an interim engine, a variant of Su-35's engines. The new engine that is supposed to equip the Su-57, the Izdeliye 30, has been delayed due to developmental issues.\n\n3. Lack of Customers: Apart from Russia, there aren't many nations expressing interest in purchasing Su-57, which can hinder its mass production and success on the global stage.\n\n4. Stealth Capabilities: Some experts have expressed concerns that the Su-57's stealth capabilities may not match those of its American counterparts, like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II.\n\n5. Technological Challenges: Critics also point out the struggle to develop and implement beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile capabilities, and other technologies, which could hinder the plane's overall effectiveness.\n\nAgain, these points are significantly debated among experts in the field, and whether the Su-57 is indeed \"doomed to failure\" may not be fully realized until its future in service is seen.\n","llama7b_response":"It is not accurate or fair to say that the Russian Sukhoi Su-57 is doomed to failure.

They knock away smaller obstacles lying directly on the running surface of the railhead. Historically, fenced-off railway systems in Europe relied exclusively on those devices and cowcatchers were not required, but in modern systems cowcatchers have generally superseded them.\nInstead of a cowcatcher, trams use a device called a fender. Objects lying on the tram track come in contact with a sensor bracket, which triggers the lowering of a basket-shaped device to the ground, preventing the overrunning of the obstacles and dragging them along the road surface in front of the wheels.\nIn snowy areas the cowcatcher also has the function of a snowplough.\nThe cowcatcher was invented by Charles Babbage in the 19th century, during his period of working for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.[1] However, Babbage's invention was not constructed, and it is uncertain whether later manufacturers were aware of Babbage's idea.\nOn a mainline locomotive, the cowcatcher has to successfully deflect an obstacle hit at speed. The design principle is to push the object upwards and sideways out of the way and not to lift the locomotive on impact.\nThe typical shape is a blunt wedge with a shallow V-shape in plan. In the later days of steam locomotives, the front coupler was designed to swing out of the way also, so it could not get caught up; this was called a 'drop coupler pilot'.\nEarly on, cowcatchers were normally fabricated of bars mounted on a frame; later on, sheet metal cowcatchers were often used for their additional smoothness, and some cast steel cowcatchers were employed for their mass and smooth shape. Early diesel locomotives followed the same plan.\nCowcatchers on early shunting locomotives in the US often had steps (called \"footboard pilots\") to allow yard workers to ride with the locomotive. In some countries, footboard pilots are outlawed for safety reasons, and have been removed. Modern locomotives often have front and rear platforms with safety rails, or deeply recessed steps, where workers can ride.\nMost modern European rail vehicles must have cowcatchers with a snowplough function and rail guards. The required strength of the system is 30 kN (3,059 kp) in the middle of the track and 50 kN (5,099 kp) near the rails.[2]\nModern US diesel locomotives have flatter, less wedge-shaped cowcatchers, because a diesel locomotive has the cab near the front, and the crew are vulnerable to impact from obstacles pushed up by the cowcatcher.\nTo protect the crew and passengers, most modern locomotives have a horizontally grooved steel beam known as an anti-climber fitted across the front, above the coupler. Its purpose is to prevent colliding locomotives from riding up and moving over the locomotive frame through the cab.\n"],"ChatGPT_response":"The \"noses\" at the front of American locomotives are called \"cowcatchers\" or \"pilot\" and they were originally designed to clear debris from the tracks, such as animals or fallen branches.

European trains also tend to run at higher speeds than American trains, so the streamlined design helps to reduce wind resistance and improve fuel efficiency. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some European trains do have a similar feature to the cowcatcher, called a \"snowplow,\" which is used to clear snow from the tracks in winter.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"American and European trains are designed differently due to geographical, historical, and logistical factors.\n\nAmerican freight trains often travel long distances across various types of landscapes, including rural and wildlife areas.

It can help with aerodynamics, allowing the train to more easily cut through air and reducing the energy required to maintain speed. It also provides some protection against wildlife that might cross the tracks.\n\nIn contrast, many European freight trains are shorter and slower due to more complex and dense railway networks, which reduces the need for aerodynamic design. European trains tend to operate more in urbanized areas, reducing their exposure to wildlife.\n\nMoreover, many European trains are electric, drawing power from overhead lines, and their design reflects the need to accommodate this equipment. Speed and efficiency are gained more from using electric power than from aerodynamics.\n\nThese are general observations and there might be exceptions to the rule, as the design can also depend on the specific purpose of the train, like high-speed passenger trains, or terrain and weather conditions.","llama7b_response":"Trains in the United States typically have a distinctive \"nose\" or \"front end\" design at the front of the locomotive, which is not found on trains in many other countries, including Europe.

The term “act of God” doesn’t appear once.  Instead, extreme weather events are listed and,  contrary to a persistent myth, these losses are generally covered or can be insured.A basic principle in insurance is risk sharing. This consists of evaluating the probability of a loss occurring and the financial consequences for each policyholder. If a loss occurs, the insurer uses the premiums collected from all its clients to compensate policyholders who suffered a loss. It’s impossible to predict where and when strong winds, forest fires, lightning, hail or tornadoes will occur. The severity of these phenomena also varies considerably: wind could blow your patio set away and damage it or cause an old tree to fall on your home’s roof and seriously damage it. These perils  are covered by most home insurance policies.The likelihood of certain natural catastrophes, such as heavy rains, floods and earthquakes, can be assessed more accurately. For example, buildings located at water’s edge are at greater risk of flooding. Some homes located in areas with compromised infrastructure are more susceptible to damage from heavy rains. As for earthquakes, seismic areas are mainly located in Quebec, British Columbia and the Yukon.Adding an endorsement to your insurance policy can protect you from such losses. The corresponding premium is calculated based on the probability of an event occurring. In cases where the risk is unavoidable or extremely high, it may be difficult to obtain the coverage you want.

Here's a brief explanation of why veins appear blue:\n\n1. Light scattering: When light enters the body, it encounters tiny blood vessels, such as veins, and is scattered in all directions. This scattering of light is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n2. Blue light absorption: Oxygen-rich blood contains a high concentration of hemoglobin, which is a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body. Hemoglobin absorbs blue light more than other wavelengths, which means that blue light is absorbed more than other colors.\n3. Reflection: When light is scattered by the blood vessels, some of it is reflected back towards the surface of the skin. The reflected light appears blue because of the absorption of blue light by the hemoglobin.\n4. Skin pigmentation: The color of the skin can also affect the appearance of veins. People with lighter skin tend to have more visible veins, as there is less melanin (the pigment that gives skin its color) to block the","llama13b_response":"Veins appear blue because of the way light interacts with the blood in the vessels. When light enters the body, it encounters oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, which absorbs the blue and red wavelengths of light. The deoxygenated hemoglobin, on the other hand, absorbs the red wavelengths of light.\n\nAs a result, the blue light is scattered in all directions and reflects back to the surface of the skin, giving the veins a blue appearance. This is known as the Tyndall effect, named after the Irish physicist John Tyndall, who first described the phenomenon in the 19th century.\n\nThe blue color of veins is particularly noticeable in the skin because the veins are relatively deep within the tissue, and the light has to travel through a longer distance to reach them. This allows more time for the blue light to be scattered and reflected back to the surface, giving the veins a more pronounced blue color.\n\nIt's worth noting that the color of veins can vary depending on the individual and their health status. For example, some people may have more oxygenated"}

It is a part of the \"Fair Youth\" sequence and is one of his \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, which focus on the complex themes of desire, lust, and sexual passion.\n\nIn Sonnet 129, Shakespeare explores the destructive and irrational nature of lust. He vividly portrays how lust can compel an individual to indulge in actions that he\/she might regret later. The sonnet is often celebrated for its vivid portrayal of human psychology.\n\nThe poem begins with a lament over the \"expense of spirit in a waste of shame\", which many interpret as physical and emotional exhaustion following a sexual act that is driven by lust, rather than love. Shakespeare criticizes the uncontrollable desire that makes people perform shameful acts and leads them into moral degradation.\n\nThe structure of Sonnet 129 follows the typical Shakespearean Sonnet form, containing 14 lines, consisting of three quatrains and a concluding couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. \n\nThe concluding couplet often contains a summarizing thought or reflection which in Sonnet 129, indicates that everyone knows well about the negative consequences of lust, yet the knowledge does not stop them from giving into lustful desires.\n\nLike much of Shakespeare's work, Sonnet 129 provides deep insights into the human condition and emotions, using elegant and powerful poetic language.","llama7b_response":"Sonnet 129, also known as \"When My Love Saw Me,\" is one of the most famous sonnets written by William Shakespeare.

The low gravity environment on Mars would likely affect the chicken's movement and jumping ability, and it's possible that the chicken could jump higher and farther than it could on Earth due to the lower gravity. However, without air resistance, the chicken would not be able to generate the same amount of lift and thrust as it would on Earth, so its jumping ability would be limited."}

By the same token, a printer of a bird guide materially breached its contract with the guide's publisher where the colors of the birds were incorrect, rendering the guide unsaleable.With respect to the fourth element, resulting damages, the law seeks to put the injured party in the same position as if the contract had not been breached. In that endeavor, the law permits the recovery of both \"direct damages\" and \"consequential damages\".Direct damages are those that flow naturally and probably from a breach of contract. For example, where the seller delivers imperfect goods, the buyer's direct damages are the difference between the value of the defective goods and their value if they had been perfect. Or if the buyer doesn't make payment, the seller's direct damages are the money he was owed.Consequential damages include whatever was within the contemplation of the parties when they entered the contract. Thus, consequential damages includes lost profits, damage to the good will of the plaintiff, and special or incidental losses (such as the cost of correcting a defective good, or of transporting the defective goods back to the seller.)But a plaintiff may not recover any damages which are speculative or indefinite. To surmount this problem, plaintiffs in substantial lawsuits will sometimes hire an expert witness, such as someone with an MBA, to opine on the degree of damages. Such witnesses aren't inexpensive-- e.g., $25,000-- but in a big case it may be worth the expense.Breach of Contract | New York Business Litigation Lawyer Richard PuThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Please do not include any confidential or sensitive information in a contact form, text message, or voicemail.

He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. Late in his career he had considerable success in television roles.\nHis family had no theatrical connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided that his son should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant-garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1965) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970).\nAmong Olivier's films are Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), and a trilogy of Shakespeare films as actor\/director: Henry V (1944), Hamlet (1948), and Richard III (1955). His later films included Spartacus (1960), The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968), Sleuth (1972), Marathon Man (1976), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). His television appearances included an adaptation of The Moon and Sixpence (1960), Long Day's Journey into Night (1973), Love Among the Ruins (1975), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976), Brideshead Revisited (1981) and King Lear (1983).\nOlivier's honours included a knighthood (1947), a life peerage (1970), and the Order of Merit (1981). For his on-screen work he received four Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, five Emmy Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards. The National Theatre's largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, given annually by the Society of London Theatre. He was married three times, to the actresses Jill Esmond from 1930 to 1940, Vivien Leigh from 1940 to 1960, and Joan Plowright from 1961 until his death.\nOlivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, the youngest of the three children of Agnes Louise (née Crookenden) and Reverend Gerard Kerr Olivier.[1] He had two older siblings: Sybille and Gerard Dacres \"Dickie\".[2] His great-great-grandfather was of French Huguenot descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen.[a] Gerard Olivier had begun a"],"ChatGPT_response":"There is no substantial evidence to suggest that Plato and Laurence Olivier had a close relationship.

A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives.[17] The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.\nDuring the breeding season, the peregrine falcon is territorial; nesting pairs are usually more than 1 km (0.62 mi) apart, and often much farther, even in areas with large numbers of pairs.[84] The distance between nests ensures sufficient food supply for pairs and their chicks. Within a breeding territory, a pair may have several nesting ledges; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two up to seven in a 16-year period.\nThe peregrine falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges.[85] The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation in which to lay eggs. No nest materials are added.[17] Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured.[21] In some regions, as in parts of Australia and on the west coast of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds.[22] In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.[11][84]\nThe pair defends the chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and mountain lions.[84] Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the great horned owl and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two species of owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night.[86][87] Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come too close to the nest by ambushing them in a full stoop.[88] In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.[89]\nThe date of egg-laying varies according to locality, but is generally from February to March in the Northern Hemisphere, and from July to August in the Southern Hemisphere, although the Australian subspecies macropus may breed as late as November, and equatorial populations may nest"],"ChatGPT_response":"The fastest animal with wings and fur is the peregrine falcon, which can reach speeds of over 240 miles per hour (386 kilometers per hour) when diving to catch prey.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"The fastest animal with wings and fur is the Brazilian Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis).

If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape.[90] The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings.[90] They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female,[21] with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.[11][52][57]\nAfter hatching, the chicks (called \"eyases\"[91]) are covered with creamy-white down and have disproportionately large feet.[84] The male (called the \"tiercel\") and the female (simply called the \"falcon\") both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young.[52] The hunting territory of the parents can extend a radius of 19 to 24 km (12 to 15 mi) from the nest site.[92] Chicks fledge 42 to 46 days after hatching, and remain dependent on their parents for up to two months.[12]\nThe peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird, and has been used in falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia.[84] Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train.[93] The peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer (\"waiting on\") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high-speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed of the stoop not only allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, it also enhances the falcon's ability to execute maneuvers to catch highly agile prey,[94] and allows the falcon to deliver a knockout blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself.[18]\nAdditionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500 g to 300 g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks.

Some observers have noted that the taller of the two major-party candidates tends to prevail, and argue this is due to the public's preference for taller candidates.[1]\nThe tallest U.S. president was Abraham Lincoln at 6 feet 4 inches (193 centimeters), while the shortest was James Madison at 5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters).\nJoe Biden, the current president, is 6 feet 0 inches (183 centimeters) according to a physical examination summary from February 2023.[2]\nFolk wisdom about U.S. presidential politics holds that the taller of the two major-party candidates always wins or almost always wins since the advent of the televised presidential debate.[15]\nThere are more data if the relationship of electoral success to height difference starts from the year 1900, rather than from the beginning of televised debates. In the thirty-one presidential elections between 1900 and 2020, twenty-one of the winning candidates have been taller than their opponents, while nine have been shorter, and one was the same height. On average the winner was 1.20 inches (3.0 cm) taller than the loser.[43]\nHowever, it may be argued that drawing the line at any date ignores the fact that pictorial depictions of presidential hopefuls have been available to the American public at large well before debates were televised. Stereographs were widely used as a form of photojournalism for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.[44] Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only once (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 22 taller vs. 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2020). Considering that political cartoons and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2020 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere 0.39 inches (1.0 cm);[45] this average height difference becomes little more than a round-off error—a mere 0.21 inches (0.5 cm)—when excluding the 2016 election, in which gender not only accounted for the height difference, but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.[45]\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however.

But is that actually true?Let’s find out.If you look at the nurse shark and the tiger shark, this belief is already proven false: these, and a few other shark species, can stop swimming whenever they want. They breathe by way of buccal pumping, actively “inhaling” water by using cheek muscles to draw it into the mouth and over the gills. This allows sharks to stop moving but continue breathing. They can rest on the ocean floor without worry and can even partially bury themselves in the sand, using respiratory openings behind the eyes, called spiracles, to pull water through their gills when their mouths are covered.But some shark species don’t have the luxury of buccal pumping. For example, the great white shark, the whale shark, and the mako shark don’t have buccal muscles at all. Instead, these sharks rely on obligate ram ventilation, a way of breathing that requires sharks to swim with their mouths open. The faster they swim, the more water is pushed through their gills. If they stop swimming, they stop receiving oxygen. They move or die.Other shark species, such as the reef shark, breathe using a combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation. When swimming slowly, they can use buccal pumping to supplement the amount of oxygen received from ventilation. And if they choose to stop moving for a few minutes, they won’t risk their life, though they generally aren’t as adept at stillness as sharks that breathe by buccal pumping alone.Of these three ways that sharks breathe, the combination of buccal pumping and obligate ram ventilation is by far the most common. Most kinds of sharks, then, won’t die if they stop swimming.So why do many people think they will?Sharks are often compared to bony fish, a class of fishes that breathe through obligate ram ventilation. Since all bony fish are constant swimmers, many people assume that all sharks are too. Even people who don’t make that connection may ask, “Have you ever seen a sleeping fish?”Before we go, here’s another myth to be busted: all fish other than sharks die if they stop swimming. In reality, breathing in nonshark fish species is just as varied as it is in shark species. Some fish sleep on the ocean floor just as some sharks do. Maybe people who think otherwise simply haven’t visited those fish at bedtime."],"ChatGPT_response":"Tiger sharks, like other sharks, need to keep swimming in order to breathe.

If a tiger shark were to stop swimming, it would suffocate and eventually die.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"Like many species of sharks, tiger sharks need to keep swimming to stay alive. This is because they use a method of respiration called ram ventilation, where oxygenated water must continuously flow over their gills. If these sharks stop swimming, water does not move through their gills, depriving them of the necessary oxygen and causing them to suffocate. Additionally, swimming helps them to maintain their buoyancy (stay afloat), since unlike many fish, sharks do not have a swim bladder.","llama7b_response":"Tiger sharks are pelagic fish, which means they spend most of their time in the open ocean, away from coastal areas. They are highly adapted to life in the water and are capable of swimming long distances without rest. In fact, tiger sharks can swim for hours or even days at a time without stopping.\n\nIf a tiger shark were to stop swimming, it would likely experience a range of negative effects. Here are some possible consequences:\n\n1. Respiratory problems: Tiger sharks are adapted to breathe in small amounts of oxygen from the water as they swim. If they stop swimming, they would not be able to get enough oxygen from the water, leading to respiratory problems.\n2. Dehydration: Tiger sharks are constantly losing water through their gills and skin, which helps them maintain their buoyancy in the water. If they stop swimming, they would not be able to replace this lost water, leading to dehydration.\n3. Muscle atrophy: Tiger sharks are built for speed and agility, and their muscles are highly specialized for swimming.","llama13b_response":"Tiger sharks, like all sharks, are fish and do not have the ability to swim in the same way that humans do.

Some observers have noted that the taller of the two major-party candidates tends to prevail, and argue this is due to the public's preference for taller candidates.[1]\nThe tallest U.S. president was Abraham Lincoln at 6 feet 4 inches (193 centimeters), while the shortest was James Madison at 5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters).\nJoe Biden, the current president, is 6 feet 0 inches (183 centimeters) according to a physical examination summary from February 2023.[2]\nFolk wisdom about U.S. presidential politics holds that the taller of the two major-party candidates always wins or almost always wins since the advent of the televised presidential debate.[15]\nThere are more data if the relationship of electoral success to height difference starts from the year 1900, rather than from the beginning of televised debates. In the thirty-one presidential elections between 1900 and 2020, twenty-one of the winning candidates have been taller than their opponents, while nine have been shorter, and one was the same height. On average the winner was 1.20 inches (3.0 cm) taller than the loser.[43]\nHowever, it may be argued that drawing the line at any date ignores the fact that pictorial depictions of presidential hopefuls have been available to the American public at large well before debates were televised. Stereographs were widely used as a form of photojournalism for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.[44] Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only once (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 22 taller vs. 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2020). Considering that political cartoons and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2020 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere 0.39 inches (1.0 cm);[45] this average height difference becomes little more than a round-off error—a mere 0.21 inches (0.5 cm)—when excluding the 2016 election, in which gender not only accounted for the height difference, but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.[45]\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however. Examples of such views include:\nA comparison of the heights of the winning presidential candidate with the losing candidate from each election since 1788 is provided below to evaluate such views.\nNotes:\n** Lost the House of Representatives vote, but received the most popular votes and a plurality of electoral votes; however, not the majority needed to win.\n† Ran unopposed\nThe tallest president elected to office was Abraham Lincoln (6 ft 3+3⁄4 in or 192.4 cm).

Born in Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the US from the age of eight and identified himself as an American, although he always retained a valid Spanish passport.[3] At the age of 48, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently.\nSantayana is popularly known for aphorisms, such as \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\",[4] \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\",[5] and the definition of beauty as \"pleasure objectified\".[6] Although an atheist, he treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised.[7] Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines. He was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's life and thought, and in many respects was a devoted Spinozist.[8]\nSantayana was born on December 16, 1863, in Madrid and spent his early childhood in Ávila, Spain. His mother Josefina Borrás was the daughter of a Spanish official in the Philippines and he was the only child of her second marriage.[9] Josefina Borrás' first husband was George Sturgis, a Bostonian merchant with the Manila firm Russell & Sturgis, with whom she had five children, two of whom died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband's death in 1857; in 1861, she moved with her three surviving children to Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A colonial civil servant, Ruiz de Santayana was a painter and minor intellectual. The family lived in Madrid and Ávila, and Jorge was born in Spain in 1863.\nIn 1869, Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the US. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her to Boston in 1872. His father, finding neither Boston nor his wife's attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila, and remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered Harvard College and began to take his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, Jorge's first name was anglicized as George, the English equivalent.\nSantayana attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he studied under the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce and was involved in eleven clubs as an alternative to athletics. He was founder and president of the Philosophical Club, a member of the literary society known as the O.K., an editor and cartoonist for The Harvard Lampoon, and co-founder of the literary journal The Harvard Monthly.[10] In December, 1885, he played the role of Lady Elfrida in the Hasty Pudding theatrical Robin Hood, followed by the production Papillonetta in the spring of his senior year.[11] He received his A.B. summa cum laude in 1886 and was elected to Phi Beta"],"ChatGPT_response":"The quote \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\" is often attributed to the Greek philosopher Plato, but it is actually a misattribution.

The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%.[117][q] In April 1955, Newsweek called the series an \"American institution\".[118] ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show catering specifically to children.[119] The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show).[120] One of the segments of Disneyland consisted of the five-part miniseries Davy Crockett which, according to Gabler, \"became an overnight sensation\".[121] The show's theme song, \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold.[122] As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, Disneyland Records.[123]\nAs well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects away from the studio.

However, the English were able to use their power and influence to manipulate the trial and secure a guilty verdict.","llama13b_response":"Joan of Arc, a French heroine who led the French army to several victories during the Hundred Years' War, was burnt at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, France. She was accused of heresy and witchcraft by the English-backed church authorities, and was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by burning.\n\nHere are some reasons why Joan of Arc was burnt at the stake:\n\n1. Religious and political differences: Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic who believed she had received divine guidance and messages from God. However, the English-backed church authorities in Rouen, who were opposed to the French monarchy and the French army, saw her as a threat to their power and accused her of heresy.\n2. Political motivations: The English had captured Joan of Arc during the Siege of Compiègne in 1430, and they wanted to use her as a pawn to gain an advantage over the French. By accusing her of heresy and witchcraft, they could discredit her and the French monarchy in the eyes of the people."}

Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (\"Qin Shi Huang\") in 221 BC.  Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords, he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states. To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north, however, he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire's northern frontier. \"Build and move on\" was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall, implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border.[25]\nTransporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today.

Argyle is a very productive mine, producing more over 12 million carats each year, second only to Botswana's Orapa. The mine is now an underground operation after several years of hard effort. Ellendale and Merlin are the other two mines in Australia, with the latter now in the ramp-up phase. The Argyle mine became the world's top producer of natural coloured diamonds, notably the Argyle pink and red diamonds, which are extremely uncommon and valuable. Mining activities, on the other hand, came to an end in November 2020.\nThroughout the twentieth century, most people would never have considered Canada to be a major diamond producer. Canada was put on the map of rough diamond-producing countries by two visionaries with a solid belief. In the Northwest Territories, some 200 kilometres north of Yellowknife, Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blossom discovered evidence of diamond-bearing Kimberlite pipes in 1991. Canada is now one of the world's leading diamond-producing nations. Diavik, Ekati, Snap Lake, and Victor are the four operating diamond mines in Canada. Ekati was the country's first operating diamond mine. Dominion Diamonds owns and operates this significant resource, which offers a diverse range of commodities. The majority of the diamonds unearthed in Canada are colourless and of high quality.\nDiamond Registry Reviews- CEO & President of Diamond Registry- 42 years of gemology experience- Member-in-Good-Standing of 7 diamond associations\nSpeak to an expert\n"],"ChatGPT_response":"Russia is the largest producer of diamonds in the world, followed by Botswana, Canada, and Australia.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"As of current records, Russia is the largest producer of diamonds in the world.","llama7b_response":"The largest producer of diamonds in the world is Russia.

The freezing environment provides a home for a diverse range of creatures.With an area of about 6.1 million square miles, the Arctic  Ocean is about 1.5 times as big as the United States. It is bordered by  Greenland, Canada, Norway, Alaska, and Russia. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is 3,953 feet and it is 18,264 feet at its deepest point.The Arctic Ocean is almost completely covered with ice for  the majority of the year and its average temperature seldom rises above  freezing. However, this ocean is anything but barren.Tunnels within sea ice called brine channels house bacteria  and algae that feed flatworms and other tunnel-dwelling creatures. Melting ice  also forms ponds on top of the ice that develop into biological communities. When the ice melts, organisms and nutrients are released  into the water. This promotes algae growth below the ice. These algae provide  food for small organisms called zooplankton, which are a food source for fish,  squid, seals, and whales. Some of these larger creatures, in turn, are preyed  upon by polar bears that live on the ice.When the creatures below the ice die, they sink to the  bottom of the ocean and provide nutrients for sponges, sea anemones, and other  bottom dwelling creatures. When these communities grow, they provide food once  again for larger creatures such as seals, fish, and whales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated:   01\/20\/23\nAuthor: NOAA\nHow to cite this articleContact Us"],"ChatGPT_response":"The smallest ocean in the world is the Arctic Ocean.

Mahayana schools in general utilize texts called sutras, stressing that lay people can also be good Buddhists, and that there are other effective paths to Nirvana in addition to meditation—for instance the chanting and good works utilized in Pure Land. They believe that the Buddha and all human beings have their origin in what is variously called Buddha Nature, Buddha Mind, or Emptiness. This is not \"nothing,\" but is the completely indescribable Source of all Existence; it is at the same time Enlightenment potential. The form of the historical Buddha was, they say, only one manifestation of Buddha Nature. Mahayana thus speaks of many past and also future Buddhas, some of whom are \"god-like\" and preside over Buddha-worlds or heavenly paradises. Especially important are bodhi sattvas—who are persons who have reached the point of Enlightenment, but turn back and take a vow to use their Enlightenment-compassion, -wisdom, and -power to help release others from their suffering. Mahayana canon says that finally there is no distinction between \"self\" and \"other,\" nor between samsara (transmigration, rebirth) and Nirvana! Because of this the bodhi sattvais capable of taking on the suffering of others in samsara and of transferring his own merit to them.Although Buddhism became virtually extinct in India (ca. 12th century C.E.)—perhaps because of the all-embracing nature of Hinduism, Muslim invasions, or too great a stress on the monk's way of life—as a religion it has more than proved its viability and practical spirituality in the countries of Asia to which it has been carried. The many forms and practices that have been developed within the Buddhist fold have also allowed many different types of people to satisfy their spiritual needs through this great religion.Author: Lise F.

In many nations, women's suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, in which cases women and men from certain socioeconomic classes or races were still unable to vote. Some countries granted suffrage to both sexes at the same time. This timeline lists years when women's suffrage was enacted. Some countries are listed more than once, as the right was extended to more women according to age, land ownership, etc. In many cases, the first voting took place in a subsequent year.\nSome women in the Isle of Man (geographically part of the British Isles but not part of the United Kingdom) gained the right to vote in 1881.[1]\nNew Zealand was the first self-governing country in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections; from 1893.[2] However women could not stand for election to parliament until 1919, when three women stood (unsuccessfully); see 1919 in New Zealand.\nThe colony of South Australia allowed women to both vote and stand for election in 1894.[3] In Sweden, conditional women's suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718 and 1772.[4] But it was not until the year 1919 that equality was achieved, where women's votes were valued the same as men's.\nThe Australian Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 enabled women to vote at federal elections and also permitted women to stand for election to the Australian Parliament, making the newly-federated country of Australia the first in the modern world to do so, although some states excluded indigenous Australians. \nIn 1906, the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, which later became the Republic of Finland, was the first country in the world to give all women and all men both the right to vote and the right to run for office. \nFinland was also the first country in Europe to give women the right to vote.[5][6] \nThe world's first female members of parliament were elected in Finland the following year. \nIn Europe, the last jurisdiction to grant women the right to vote was the Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI), in 1991; AI is the smallest Swiss canton with c. 14,100 inhabitants in 1990.[7] Women in Switzerland obtained the right to vote at federal level in 1971,[8] and at local cantonal level between 1959 and 1972, except for Appenzell in 1989\/1990,[9] see Women's suffrage in Switzerland. \nIn Saudi Arabia women were first allowed to vote in December 2015 in the municipal elections.[10]\nFor other women's rights, see timeline of women's legal rights (other than voting).\n1689\n1718\n1734\n1755\n1776\n1838\n1840\n1848\n1853\n1856\n1861\n1862\n1863\n1864\n1869\n1870\n1881\n1884\n1888\n1889\n1893\n1894\n1895\n1896\n1898\n1899\n1901\n1902\n1903\n1905\n1906\n1908\n1910\n1911\n1912\n1913\n1914\n1915\n1916\n1920\n1921\n1922\n1923\n1924\n1925\n1926\n1927\n1928\n1929\n1930\n1931\n1932\n1934\n1935\n1937\n1938\n1939\n1940\n1941\n1942\n1944\n1945\n1946\n1947\n1948\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n1961\n1962\n1963\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n1978\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1989\n1991\n1996\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2006\n2015\n2021\nNote: In some countries, both men and women have limited suffrage.

A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible. The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device. That information is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in response to increased demand, such as when a patient is exercising.[36] This distinguishes it from previous designs that maintain a constant flow rate.[citation needed]\nThe Carmat device, unlike previous designs, is meant to be used in cases of terminal heart failure, instead of being used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant.[37] At 900 grams it weighs nearly three times the typical heart and is targeted primarily towards obese men. It also requires the patient to carry around an additional Li-Ion battery. The projected lifetime of the artificial heart is around 5 years (230 million beats).[38]\nIn 2016, trials for the Carmat \"fully artificial heart\" were banned by the National Agency for Security and Medicine in Europe after short survival rates were confirmed. The ban was lifted in May 2017. At that time, a European report stated that Celyad's C-Cure cell therapy for ischemic heart failure[39] \"could only help a subpopulation of Phase III study participants, and Carmat will hope that its artificial heart will be able to treat a higher proportion of heart failure patients\".[40]\nThe Carmat artificial heart was approved for sale in the European Union, receiving a CE marking on December 22, 2020.[41] Its stock price increased over a third upon the announcement of the news.[42]\nThe U.S. Army artificial heart pump was a compact, air-powered unit developed by Kenneth Woodward at Harry Diamond Laboratories in the early to mid-1960s.[43][44] The Army's heart pump was partially made of plexiglass, and consisted of two valves, a chamber, and a suction flapper.[43] The pump operated without any moving parts under the principle of fluid amplification – providing a pulsating air pressure source resembling a heartbeat.[44]\nSince 1991, the Foundation for Cardiac Surgery Development (FRK) in Zabrze, Poland, has been working on developing an artificial heart. Nowadays,[when?] the Polish system for heart support POLCAS consists of the artificial ventricle POLVAD-MEV and the three controllers POLPDU-401, POLPDU-402 and POLPDU-501.

As a result of this, the Blue Nile was known as far as its exit from the Ethiopian foothills and the White Nile as far as the mouth of the Sobat River. Three expeditions under a Turkish officer, Selim Bimbashi, were made between 1839 and 1842, and two got to the point about 30 kilometres (20 miles) beyond the present port of Juba, where the country rises and rapids make navigation very difficult.\nLake Victoria was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while traveling with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, was outraged that Speke claimed to have proven his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A quarrel ensued which sparked intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary David Livingstone pushed too far west and entered the Congo River system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake's northern shore.\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river using sails and down river using the flow of the river. While most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the Aswan Dam ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The river's flow is disturbed at several points by the Cataracts of the Nile which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The Sudd also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impedes water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to build the Jonglei Canal to bypass the swamp.[77][78]\nNile cities include Khartoum, Aswan, Luxor (Thebes), and the Giza – Cairo conurbation. The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as feluccas. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at Edfu and Kom Ombo along the way.

The former has the power to strike down proposals on legal technicalities while the latter organises meetings, agendas and minutes. The president's control over these areas gives them further political tools when directing the work of the Commission. This has also increased the presidential style of the Commission president.[74]\nWith the reorganisation of leading EU posts under the Lisbon Treaty, there was some criticism of each post's vague responsibilities. Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The Commission president speaks as the EU's \"government\" while the president of the European Council is a \"strategist\". The High Representative specialises in \"bilateral relations\" while the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine. The president of the European Parliament meanwhile articulates the EU's values.[75]\nThe MEP and author of several EU text books Richard Corbett has suggested that, instead of every EU institution having a \"president\", it would have been clearer if they had been named differently, with a \"Speaker\" of the Parliament, a \"Governor\" of the Central Bank, a \"Chairman\" of the (ordinary) Council of Ministers, a \"president\" of the European Council, and a \"Prime Commissioner\".\nDespite the presidential style, the president has also lost ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, Italy, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased with the creation of the permanent president of the European Council.[76] There was disagreement and concern over competition between the former president of the European Council Van Rompuy and the former Commission president Barroso due to the vague language of the treaty. Some clarifications saw Van Rompuy as the \"strategist\" and Barroso as a head of government. In terms of economic planning Van Rompuy saw the Commission as dealing with the content of the plan and the European Council as dealing with the means and implementing it. Despite weekly breakfasts together there was a certain extent of rivalry between the two, as well as with the High Representative.[75][77][78] At international summits, both presidents represented the Union, with, in principle, the Commission president speaking on economic questions and the European Council president on political questions, although this division is often hard to maintain in practice.\nAlthough there are concerns that this competition with the European Council president would lead to increased infighting,[79] there are provisions for combining the two offices.

There, they break off their wings using their tibial spurs and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch, known as nanitics,[75] are weaker and smaller than later workers but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,[73] a process akin to swarming in honeybees.\nAnts communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch.[76] Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.[76][77]\nAnts use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \"propaganda pheromones\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.[78] Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia.[64] Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony.[79] This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to.[80] In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.[81]\nSome ants produce sounds by stridulation, using the gaster segments and their mandibles. Sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species.[82][83]\nAnts attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging often injecting or spraying chemicals. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt sting pain index.[84]\nThe sting of jack jumper ants can be lethal for humans,[85] and an"],"ChatGPT_response":"There are over 12,000 known species of ants in the world, and scientists estimate that there may be as many as 22,000 species in total.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"There are more than 12,000 known species of ants worldwide.

Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surroundings and rises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the earth's rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow.[21]\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100 °C), but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0 °C), due to water's highly polar attraction. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point, unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere,[22][23][24] as the water condenses and exits, primarily in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere.[25] Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, being well-mixed in the atmosphere, tend to rise above water vapour. The absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth's emission to space, and thus the planetary greenhouse effect.[23][26][27] This greenhouse forcing is directly observable, via distinct spectral features versus water vapor, and observed to be rising with rising CO2 levels.[28] Conversely, adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact, which is why jet traffic[29][30][31] has a disproportionately high warming effect. Oxidation of methane is also a major source of water vapour in the stratosphere,[32] and adds about 15% to methane's global warming effect.[33]\nIn the absence of other greenhouse gases, Earth's water vapor would condense to the surface;[34][35][36] this has likely happened, possibly more than once. Scientists thus distinguish between non-condensable (driving) and condensable (driven) greenhouse gases, i.e., the above water vapor feedback.[37][20][19]\nFog and clouds form through condensation around cloud condensation nuclei. In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures.

Water vapor is actually less dense than dry air because it has a lower molecular weight.

This is because the molecular mass of water vapor is less than the average molecular mass of air.","llama7b_response":"Water vapor is generally denser than air.\n\nThe density of a gas is typically defined as its mass per unit volume. The density of water vapor, also known as steam, is typically around 1-2 kg\/m³ (kilograms per cubic meter) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe density of air, on the other hand, is much lower, typically around 1.2-1.3 kg\/m³ at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nSo, water vapor is denser than air by a factor of around 2-3. This means that a given volume of water vapor will have a mass that is twice to three times greater than the same volume of air.\n\nIt's worth noting that the density of water vapor can vary depending on temperature and pressure. For example, at higher temperatures, the density of water vapor will be lower, while at higher pressures, the density will be higher.","llama13b_response":"Air is denser than water vapor.\n\nThe density of air at sea level and room temperature (20°C) is approximately 1.2 kg\/m³.\n\nThe density of water vapor at the same conditions is approximately 0.3 kg\/m³, which is much lower than the density of air.\n\nThis means that air is about 4 times denser than water vapor."}

Some of the differences reflect different types of oil included. Different estimates may or may not include oil shale, mined oil sands or natural gas liquids.\nBecause proven reserves include oil recoverable under current economic conditions, nations may see large increases in proven reserves when known, but previously uneconomic deposits become economic to develop.

Similarly, Venezuela's proven reserves jumped in the late 2000s when the heavy oil of the Orinoco Belt was judged economic.\nSources sometimes differ on the volume of proven oil reserves.

Rent, home prices and college costs have all increased faster than incomes in the U.S.\"As SLH's data shows, housing prices have gone way up. In 1960, the median home value in the U.S. was $11,900, which is the equivalent of around $98,000 in today's dollars, and in 2000, SLH notes, it rose to over $170,000. And it has only kept rising. As of April 2018, the median home value has ballooned to over $210,200, according to Zillow.

This is due to several factors such as advancements in technology, increased competition, and globalization. These factors have led to increased efficiency in production and distribution, which has resulted in lower prices for consumers. Additionally, the purchasing power of the average American has increased over time due to rising incomes and inflation. However, it is important to note that the affordability of goods can vary depending on the specific product and location.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"This is a complex question as it involves many factors like inflation, income growth, changes in the quality of goods, and shifts in consumer preferences. Some goods have become much more affordable since 1960 due to advances in technology and production efficiency, such as technology-based products. Computers, TVs, and other electronics are not just cheaper but also more powerful than their counterparts in the 1960s. \n\nOn the other hand, some everyday goods such as housing, education, and healthcare have outpaced wage growth and inflation, effectively making them less affordable for the average American. For example, compared to 1960, today's average American spends a larger percentage of their income on housing and healthcare. \n\nIn general, affordability isn't solely about the price of goods or services, but also about income and wealth. While the average nominal income has risen since 1960, the distribution of those income gains differ significantly across the income spectrum, meaning not all Americans have experienced the same changes in affordability.\n\nTherefore, the answer will be different based on the type of goods we're talking about and the specific income group. However, it's fair to say that while some goods have become more affordable, others have not, particularly when considering factors such as stagnant wage growth for many American households.","llama7b_response":"The affordability of everyday goods for the average American has varied over time and has been influenced by a number of factors, including inflation, economic growth, and changes in consumer spending patterns.\n\nSince 1960, the general trend has been that the prices of many everyday goods have increased, although the rate of increase has varied over time. For example, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services, has increased by about 700% since 1960. This means that the average American has seen the purchasing power of their income decline over this period, as the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services than it could in the past.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the CPI does not account for changes in the quality of goods and services over time, which can also affect their affordability.

In fact, for much of its history, people from the rest of the U.S. have tended to view the city as a godless metropolis in a largely god-fearing land.The statistics, though, tell a very different story. If belonging to a religion translates to being religious, New Yorkers are very religious when compared to Americans as a whole. The proportion of people identified as adhering to an organized religion in New York City makes the five boroughs as religious as many places in the so-called \"Bible Belt.\" Yet people here belong - and do not belong - to different religions than residents of other parts of the country.An estimated 6.8 million New Yorkers - or more than 83 percent of the population -- were identified as being affiliated with some organized religion in 2000. This rate of adherents is higher than all the states except Louisiana - even slightly higher than Utah. (These numbers include those who were said to be affiliated with many different religious groups and were adjusted to take into account non-reporting and other factors.)Since 1990, though, there seems to be some decline in religious affiliation in New York City. In 2000, three-fifths of all New Yorkers were reported as affiliated with one or another religious body and so were called religious \"adherents.\" The number was down to 4.8 million from just over 5 million in 1990. (These are the unadjusted figures.)The data used here are from the Religious Congregations and Membership Survey sponsored by the Association of Statisticians of Religious Bodies and distributed by the Association of Religious Data Archives. These data ask representatives of each congregation for the number of members they serve. Data on religious adherents was released February 1 and are available through www.socialexplorer.com Social Explorer and from the www.thearda.com Association of Religious Data Archives.Looking at the whole metropolitan area, which includes 39 counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as Pike County, Pennsylvania, almost 79 percent of the population are adherents, making the metro area 31st out of 276 in terms of religious affiliation. Virtually all the metropolitan areas reporting a higher proportion are in the South, including Lafayette, Louisiana, with the New York City area having a higher proportion of adherents than the Salt Lake City or Little Rock area.Furthermore, New York State is the fifth most religious state. Only Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah and North Dakota have a higher proportion of religious adherents.At the other end of the scale, West Virginia, Maine, Nevada, Washington and Oregon have the smallest percentage of their populations identified as belonging to an organized religion. Between 35 percent and 40 percent of their residents are adherents, compared to New York State's 75 percent.

Recently, crows were even shown to have a numerical ability seen in few other species so far: a grasp of the concept of the empty set — the numerosity zero.June HunterSenior WriterAugust 9, 2021An understanding of numbers is often viewed as a distinctly human faculty — a hallmark of our intelligence that, along with language, sets us apart from all other animals.But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Honeybees count landmarks when navigating toward sources of nectar. Lionesses tally the number of roars they hear from an intruding pride before deciding whether to attack or retreat. Some ants keep track of their steps; some spiders keep track of how many prey are caught in their web. One species of frog bases its entire mating ritual on number: If a male calls out — a whining pew followed by a brief pulsing note called a chuck — his rival responds by placing two chucks at the end of his own call. The first frog then responds with three, the other with four, and so on up to around six, when they run out of breath.Practically every animal that scientists have studied — insects and cephalopods, amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals — can distinguish between different numbers of objects in a set or sounds in a sequence. They don’t just have a sense of “greater than” or “less than,” but an approximate sense of quantity: that two is distinct from three, that 15 is distinct from 20. This mental representation of set size, called numerosity, seems to be “a general ability,” and an ancient one, said Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento in Italy.Now, researchers are uncovering increasingly more complex numerical abilities in their animal subjects. Many species have displayed a capacity for abstraction that extends to performing simple arithmetic, while a select few have even demonstrated a grasp of the quantitative concept of “zero” — an idea so paradoxical that very young children sometimes struggle with it. In fact, experiments have shown that both monkeys and honeybees know how to treat zero as a numerosity, placing it on a mental number line much as they would numerosity one or two. And in a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience in June, researchers reported that crows can do it, too.Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inboxIn mating competitions, male túngara frogs take turns adding one sound to their calls.Michael J. RyanThe fact that those three species are from diverse taxonomic groups — primates, insects and birds — suggests that certain numerical abilities have evolved over and over again throughout the animal kingdom. Scientists are puzzling over why nature has gifted so many animals with at least a rudimentary knack for numbers, and what if anything that might tell us about the deep origins of human mathematics.

The film follows a poor, drug-addled, irresponsible pregnant woman who unexpectedly attracts national attention from those involved in the abortion debate. This film marked Kenneth Mars’ final theatrical film role.\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996.[4] It later opened in limited release in the United States on December 13, 1996.\nRuth Stoops is an inebriated addict in Nebraska who is capable of doing nearly anything to get money or drugs. She has four children, all of whom have been taken from her custody by the state because of her inability to care for them. One morning, Ruth and her boyfriend have intercourse on a bed in a flophouse, after which he disrespectfully throws her out of the apartment. After, she visits the home of her brother and sister-in-law to sneak a look at two of her children and to beg her brother for money. Despite being family, she waits at the back door similar to a dog. She later goes to a hardware store to buy wood sealant and huffs it in a paper bag in an alley to get high.\nAfter Ruth is arrested for her continuing drug use, she discovers that she is pregnant again. At her arraignment, she learns to her horror that she is facing felony charges for endangering a fetus; her many earlier arrests had all been on misdemeanors. The judge, who knows of the situation with Ruth's other children, informs her after the hearing that he will lessen her sentence if she has an abortion. Ruth is bailed out of jail by Norm and Gail Stoney, a middle-aged radical Evangelical couple who have become aware of Ruth's story through the local news. The couple take her into their home and attempt to persuade her to keep her child. On the first night, Ruth, impervious to their convictions, sneaks out of the house with the couple's reckless teenage daughter, Cheryl, and again huffs paint and smokes marijuana.\nAt the Stoneys' urging, Ruth visits a crisis pregnancy center where she is further persuaded to go forward with her pregnancy, despite her resistance given her limited opportunities and drug problem. After she is found huffing glue at an anti-abortion protest with Gail and Norm, they kick her out of the house. Diane, a friend of Gail's who participates in abortion protests, offers to take Ruth in. Upon arriving at Diane's farmhouse, Diane discloses that she is in fact a lesbian abortion-rights activist and spy who attempts to help women she feels the Stoneys and others prey upon.

Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[234]Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. \"Did I fence with Boies? ...

Japan has had a long love affair with the game of golf since it was imported into the country near the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century, many fine courses were completed as the game became fashionable among Japan’s elite.

Bryophytes, club mosses, ferns then appear in the fossil record.[37] Early plant anatomy is preserved in cellular detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert. These early plants were preserved by being petrified in chert formed in silica-rich volcanic hot springs.[38]\nBy the end of the Devonian, most of the basic features of plants today were present, including roots, leaves and secondary wood in trees such as Archaeopteris.[39][40] The Carboniferous Period saw the development of forests in swampy environments dominated by clubmosses and horsetails, including some as large as trees, and the appearance of early gymnosperms, the first seed plants.[41] The Permo-Triassic extinction event radically changed the structures of communities.[42] This may have set the scene for the evolution of flowering plants in the Triassic (~200 million years ago), with an adaptive radiation in the Cretaceous so rapid that Darwin called it an \"abominable mystery\".[43][44][45] Conifers diversified from the Late Triassic onwards, and became a dominant part of floras in the Jurassic.[46][47]\nCross-section of a stem of Rhynia, an early land plant, preserved in Rhynie chert from the early Devonian\nBy the Devonian, plants had adapted to land with roots and woody stems.\nIn the Carboniferous, horsetails such as Asterophyllites proliferated in swampy forests.\nConifers became diverse and often dominant in the Jurassic.

Police officers approach the Martian waving a flag of truce, but it and its companions respond by firing a heat ray, which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of dead air, an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to \"some difficulty with [their] field transmission\".\nAfter a brief \"piano interlude\", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates.

The studio returns and describes the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the Great Swamp near Morristown. The Secretary of the Interior reads a brief statement trying to reassure a panicked nation, after which it is reported that more explosions have been observed on Mars, indicating that more war machines are on the way.\nA live connection is established to a field artillery battery in the Watchung Mountains. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous black smoke, before fading into the sound of coughing.

Radio operators go active and fall silent: although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five spread black smoke across the Jersey Marshes into Newark.\nEventually, a news reporter broadcasting from atop the Broadcasting Building describes the Martian invasion of New York City – \"five great machines\" wading the Hudson \"like [men] wading through a brook\", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the East River \"like rats\", others in Times Square \"falling like flies\".

Many soldiers who served in wars and conflicts throughout history have lived into old age, but unfortunately, not all of them have lived to be very old.\n\nThe life expectancy of soldiers varies depending on a number of factors, including the time period they served in, the type of combat they were in, and their individual circumstances. For example, soldiers who served in World War II were generally in their 20s and 30s during the war, and many of them lived into their 70s and 80s after the war. However, some soldiers who served in earlier conflicts, such as the American Civil War, may have had shorter life expectancies due to the harsh conditions and lack of medical care at the time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many soldiers have died from a variety of causes related to their military service, including combat injuries, diseases, and suicide. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, approximately 22 veterans die every day from suicide, and many more suffer from a range of physical and mental health problems related to their service.\n\nOverall, while many old soldiers have lived long lives","llama13b_response":"Yes, old soldiers can and do die.

For example, last year a large study from Canada found that high school students did better in math, science and English classes if they also took music lessons.That study was not one of the ones included in this new meta-analysis, because it hadn't randomly assigned students to attend music classes or not. That means that there could have been other factors, besides music, that determined how well the students did in their classes. For example, perhaps the students who already did well in school were more likely to be the ones who were encouraged to take music, while those struggling were advised to focus on other subjects. Or the students who took music lessons were from wealthier families, more likely to invest in music activities beyond the school curriculum. But as I mentioned when I covered this Canadian study last year, the authors took all of that into account and still found that kids who had taken music lessons fared better in other classes.At first glance, that sounds very different from what this new study by Sala and Gobet found. How can it be possible for music lessons to have no effect on intelligence, and still lead to kids doing better in school?It seems like there is something about music lessons that makes students able to perform better in their other classes. That doesn't have to be intelligence, and it's likely not. If intelligence was the main factor behind school performance, every student would always do equally well in their classes. But they don't. Grades go up and down over the years so there must be other factors besides intelligence or the ability to take a test that could affect how well someone does in school. Music lessons could have helped in different ways: They could have led to a change in homework habits, they could have increased confidence, or they could have improved social skills.Sala and Gobet's analysis only looked at measures of intelligence and performance on particular tests, not at any of the other possible factors that would lead a student to do better in class. The authors even mention this in their paper. They say \"music may be beneficial for non-cognitive constructs in children, such as prosocial behavior and self-esteem\".And finally, they also mention that music education could still be very beneficial to students' performance in non-music subjects if the music is integrated into these classes.

It is something we do almost every day, for much of the day, for decades on end. Because it is so central, looking closely at how much time we spend working can tell us a lot about our lives and the societies we live in.How much do people around the world work? In many countries today, people work much less than in the past 150 years. Working less means being able to spend time becoming more educated, or simply enjoying leisure time. This is substantial progress, but there are still huge inequalities across and within countries, and progress still to make.Here we present the data on working hours. We explore how it differs across countries and over time and how these differences matter for people’s lives.In today’s hustle and bustle world, it’s easy to assume that we are all, by and large, working more than ever. But is that really the case?As we explain in detail below, the research on the history of working hours shows that this is not the case.The available data shows that in the 19th century people across the world used to work extremely long hours, but in the last 150 years working hours have decreased substantially, particularly in today’s richest countries.The chart here shows average working hours since 1870 for a selection of countries that industrialized early. You can add or remove countries by clicking \n\n\n\n            Add country\n         on the chart.We show annual totals, so the trends account for changes in both the length of working days as well as the number of days worked through the year. The data comes from research by the economic historians Michael Huberman and Chris Minns, who have brought together evidence from historical records, National Accounts data, and other sources.1The chart shows that average working hours declined dramatically for workers in early-industrialized economies over the last 150 years. In 1870, workers in most of these countries worked more than 3,000 hours annually — equivalent to a grueling 60–70 hours each week for 50 weeks per year.But we see that today those extreme working hours have been roughly cut in half. In Germany, for example, annual working hours decreased by nearly 60% — from 3,284 hours in 1870 to 1,354 hours in 2017 — and in the UK the decrease was around 40%. Before this revolution in working hours people worked as many hours between January and July as we work today in an entire year.2For many countries in the chart we don’t have long-run series going back to the 19th century. But we do have evidence from other historical records from 1870–1900 that in many of those countries workers also used to work extremely long hours.3For those countries with long-run data in this chart we can see three distinct periods: From 1870–1913 there was a relatively slow decline; then from 1913–1938 the decline in hours steepened in the midst of the powerful sociopolitical, technological,"],"ChatGPT_response":"According to data from the Office for National Statistics, the average number of hours worked per week in England has remained relatively stable over the past few decades.

Female mammals generally have a clitoris, labia majora and labia minora on the outside, while the internal system contains paired oviducts, 1–2 uteri, 1–2 cervices and a vagina. Marsupials have two lateral vaginas and a medial vagina. The \"vagina\" of monotremes is better understood as a \"urogenital sinus\". The uterine systems of placental mammals can vary between a duplex, where there are two uteri and cervices which open into the vagina, a bipartite, where two uterine horns have a single cervix that connects to the vagina, a bicornuate, which consists where two uterine horns that are connected distally but separate medially creating a Y-shape, and a simplex, which has a single uterus.[122][123][88]: 220–221, 247 \nThe ancestral condition for mammal reproduction is the birthing of relatively undeveloped, either through direct vivipary or a short period as soft-shelled eggs. This is likely due to the fact that the torso could not expand due to the presence of epipubic bones. The oldest demonstration of this reproductive style is with Kayentatherium, which produced undeveloped perinates, but at much higher litter sizes than any modern mammal, 38 specimens.[124] Most modern mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypus and the four species of echidna, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals.[125] In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal.[126]\nViviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and generally giving birth to a number of undeveloped newborns that then undergo further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy.[79] Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way.[41] The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods.[127] They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.[128] In placental mammals, the epipubic is either completely lost or converted into the baculum; allowing the torso to be able to expand and thus birth developed offspring.[124]\nThe mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.[129] Compared to placental mammals, the milk of marsupials changes greatly in both production rate and in nutrient composition, due"],"ChatGPT_response":"Yes, all mammals are vertebrates.

Most of the African-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European\/indigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in the fact that, in the 2015 inter-census, 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 7.4% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language.[5][332] The states with the highest self-report of Afro-Mexicans were Guerrero (8.6% of the population), Oaxaca (4.7%) and Baja California Sur (3.3%).[5][333] Afro-Mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and Costa Chica of Guerrero.\nDuring the early 20th century, a substantial number of Arabs (mostly Christians)[citation needed] began arriving from the crumbling Ottoman Empire.

One set, the dorsal ribs, are found in the dividing septum between the upper and lower parts of the main muscle segments, projecting roughly sideways from the vertebral column. The second set, the ventral ribs arise from the vertebral column just below the dorsal ribs, and enclose the lower body, often joining at the tips. Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks, for example, have no dorsal ribs, and only very short ventral ribs. In some teleosts, there may be additional rib-like bones within the muscle mass.[9]\nTetrapods, however, only ever have a single set of ribs which are probably homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes. In the earlier choanates, every vertebra bore a pair of ribs, although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest. The sacral ribs were stout and short, since they formed part of the pelvis, connecting the backbone to the hip bones.[9]\nIn most true tetrapods, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilaginous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis.[9]\nIn birds, ribs are present as distinct bones only on the thoracic region, although small fused ribs are present on the cervical vertebrae.  The thoracic ribs of birds possess a wide projection to the rear; this uncinate process is an attachment for the shoulder muscles.[9] \nUsually dogs have 26 ribs.\nMammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In therian mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals.[9]\nRibs as food are widely used from many animals, such as cows, pigs, hogs, sheep and pandas. The ribs are the less meaty part of the meat chop and they are often cooked as part of a slab; five or more is known as a rack, as in a rack of lamb. Short ribs are ribs of beef either served singly or several as a plate. A rib steak from beef is a popular choice used in many cuisines.

For example, economist John Pencavel (2015) studied munitions workers in war-time Britain and found that their productivity stayed high up to a certain threshold of hours, but declined markedly above that threshold.15 We’ve probably all experienced the drop in productivity that comes at the end of a very long day of work.The data show that it is workers in poorer countries who tend to work more, and sometimes a lot more, than those in richer countries.This has large implications for the way we think about the economic progress made in the last two centuries and the nature of inequality between countries today.It means that residents of today’s poorer countries like Cambodia and Myanmar — and also of today’s richer countries in the past when they were poor — are not just consumption poor, often unable to afford necessities like food and medicine. It means they are also leisure poor: because productivity is low and they must work so much just to scrape by, they can’t afford to spend much time improving their condition, becoming educated, or simply enjoying leisure time.That people in poorer countries work so much more than in richer countries shows that differences in prosperity are not due to differences in work ethic — they are largely due to differences in circumstance and opportunity. As we ask in another post, “what would have been the chances for Steve Jobs if he was born in the Central African Republic?” No matter how hard he worked or how smart he was, it is difficult to imagine that Steve Jobs would’ve been able to realize his potential with such a steep mountain of inequality to climb.We also see what the world misses out on when exceptionally talented people, including all the brilliant but underprivileged people in today’s poorest countries, don’t have the opportunity to realize their potential.16Finding ways to raise productivity is therefore not just key to increasing production, but also to the reduction in working hours that is necessary for a society to flourish.Work is a central part of our lives. It is something we do almost every day, for much of the day, for decades on end. Because it is so central, looking closely at how much time we spend working can tell us a lot about our lives and the societies we live in.The data on working hours shows, for example, that rather than working more than ever — as is so commonly believed — people in many countries today work much less than in the past 150 years.Working less means being able to spend time becoming more educated, or simply enjoying more leisure time. This is substantial progress, but there is still huge inequality across countries, and progress still to make.To understand these changes in societies and people’s lives over time, and the substantial differences we see in the world today, it is crucial to measure and study how much time people spend working.How are working hours actually measured?

There are also apps that you can use to see what your dog is seeing at any time.Now that you know that dogs don’t see certain colors, it would make sense to choose products for them that feature the colors they can see. This knowledge may help explain why some dogs go crazy over yellow tennis balls, but are apathetic about the same ball in pink or red.When you’re throwing a ball or a bumper for your dog to retrieve in the grass or the lake, don’t choose something red, or he’s likely to lose it. And if you’re teaching him to differentiate between two toys or obedience training dumbells, it would be wise to go for one blue and one yellow.AKC Family Dog columnist Stanley Coren offered this observation: “The most popular colors for dog toys today are red or orange. However red and orange are difficult for dogs to see. That means that when your own pet version of Lassie runs right past the toy that you tossed, she may not be stubborn or stupid.

Its European peoples primarily of ethnic French, Spanish and Mexican descent were largely Catholic; in addition, there was a large population of enslaved Africans, as Spain had continued the transatlantic slave trade. This was particularly true in the area of the present-day state of Louisiana, which also contained a large number of free people of color. Both present-day Arkansas and Missouri already had some slaveholders in the 18th and early 19th century.[60]\nDuring this period, south Louisiana received a large influx of French-speaking refugees fleeing the large slave revolt in Saint-Domingue, including planters who brought their slaves with them. Many Southern slaveholders feared that acquisition of the new territory might inspire American-held slaves to follow the example of those in Saint-Domingue and revolt. They wanted the U.S. government to establish laws allowing slavery in the newly acquired territory so they could be supported in taking their slaves there to undertake new agricultural enterprises, as well as to reduce the threat of future slave rebellions.[61]\nThe Louisiana Territory was broken into smaller portions for administration, and the territories passed slavery laws similar to those in the southern states but incorporating provisions from the preceding French and Spanish rule (for instance, Spain had prohibited slavery of Native Americans in 1769, but some slaves of mixed African–Native American descent were still being held in St. Louis in Upper Louisiana when the U.S. took over).[62] In a freedom suit that went from Missouri to the U.S. Supreme Court, slavery of Native Americans was finally ended in 1836.[62] The institutionalization of slavery under U.S. law in the Louisiana Territory contributed to the American Civil War a half century later.[61] As states organized within the territory, the status of slavery in each state became a matter of contention in Congress, as southern states wanted slavery extended to the west, and northern states just as strongly opposed new states being admitted as \"slave states.\" The Missouri Compromise of 1820 was a temporary solution.[63]\nAfter the early explorations, the U.S. government sought to establish control of the region, since trade along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers was still dominated by British and French traders from Canada and allied Indians, especially the Sauk and Fox. The U.S. adapted the former Spanish facility at Fort Bellefontaine as a fur trading post near St. Louis in 1804 for business with the Sauk and Fox.[64] In 1808 two military forts with trading factories were built, Fort Osage along the Missouri River in western present-day Missouri and Fort Madison along the Upper Mississippi River in eastern present-day Iowa.[65] With tensions increasing with Great Britain, in 1809 Fort Bellefontaine was converted to a U.S. military fort and was used for that purpose until 1826.[66]\nDuring the War of 1812, Great Britain hoped to annex all or at least portions of the Louisiana Purchase should they successfully defeat the U.S. Aided by their Indian allies, the British defeated U.S. forces in the Upper Mississippi; the"],"ChatGPT_response":"The Louisiana Purchase was signed by President Thomas Jefferson on April 30, 1803.","cat":"","GPT4_response":"The Louisiana Purchase was signed by Robert Livingston and James Monroe on behalf of the United States and Barbé Marbois, French Finance Minister, for France in 1803.","llama7b_response":"The Louisiana Purchase was a treaty signed between the United States and France on April 30, 1803, in which the United States acquired approximately 828,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River for $15 million.\n\nThe treaty was signed by:\n\n* Robert Livingston, the United States Minister to France\n* James Monroe, the United States Minister to France\n* François Barbé-Marbois, the French Minister of the Navy and Secretary of State for the Colonies\n\nThe treaty was negotiated by Livingston, Monroe, and Barbé-Marbois in Paris, France, and it was ratified by the United States Senate on June 20, 1803.

They have recommended that image recorders be placed into smaller aircraft that are not required to have a CVR or FDR.[69] The rationale is that what is seen on an instrument by the pilots of an aircraft is not necessarily the same as the data sent to the display device. This is particularly true of aircraft equipped with electronic displays (CRT or LCD). A mechanical instrument panel is likely to preserve its last indications, but this is not the case with an electronic display. Such systems, estimated to cost less than $8,000 installed, typically consist of a camera and microphone located in the cockpit to continuously record cockpit instrumentation, the outside viewing area, engine sounds, radio communications, and ambient cockpit sounds. As with conventional CVRs and FDRs, data from such a system is stored in a crash-protected unit to ensure survivability.[69][better source needed] Since the recorders can sometimes be crushed into unreadable pieces, or even located in deep water, some modern units are self-ejecting (taking advantage of kinetic energy at impact to separate themselves from the aircraft) and also equipped with radio emergency locator transmitters and sonar underwater locator beacons to aid in their location.[70]\nThe artwork for the band Rammstein's album Reise, Reise is made to look like a CVR; it also includes a recording from a crash.
