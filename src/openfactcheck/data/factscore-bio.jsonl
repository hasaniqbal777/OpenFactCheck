His efforts to stabilize the nation's economy and assert greater control over the government bureaucracy were greatly appreciated, leading to his appointment as Prime Minister in 1932.\n\nAs a dictator, Salazar led the establishment of the New State (Estado Novo), an authoritarian government marked by nationalist and conservative ideologies. The New State platform promoted economic stabilization and growth, Portuguese colonialism, strict public morality, and systemic suppression of dissent and opposition.\n\nWhilst Salazar's regime was credited with maintaining political stability and financial growth throughout Portugal, his leadership was also characterized by widespread human rights abuses, severe restrictions on freedom of speech, and institutionalized discrimination.\n\nIn 1968, Salazar was incapacitated due to a stroke. His political reign ended, and Marcelo Caetano succeeded him as the Prime Minister of Portugal. Salazar lived secluded in his residence until his death on July 27, 1970.\n\nSalazar's influence on Portuguese politics and society was significant and long-lasting, leaving a mixed legacy that continues to spur debate in contemporary Portugal. His government's policies significantly shaped the character of Portugal as a nation, but they also led to international isolation, economic stagnation in the final years, and contributed to triggering the colonial wars in Africa.","llama7b_response":"António de Oliveira Salazar (1889-1970) was a Portuguese politician and economist who served as the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1933 to 1968, during which time he implemented a authoritarian regime known as the \"Estado Novo.\"\n\nEarly Life and Education:\nAntónio de Oliveira Salazar was born on April 7, 1889, in the village of Santa Comba Dão, in the northern Portuguese district of Viseu.

He issued several fatwas, or religious declarations, against the United States.\n\nFollowing a string of terrorist attacks, including the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, the U.S. declared bin Laden and al-Qaeda as major threats to its national security.\n\nBin Laden masterminded the most devastating act of terrorism in U.S. history, the September 11, 2001, attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people.

He served as a surgeon in the Egyptian Army before founding Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, in 1980.

In 1988, Osama Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri co-founded al-Qaeda. Both played active roles in the planning and execution of significant terror attacks worldwide, including the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001.\n\nFollowing Bin Laden's death in 2011, al-Zawahiri assumed leadership of al-Qaeda.
