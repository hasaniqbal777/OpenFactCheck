{"whole_document_context":"Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a technique commonly used in natural language processing for tokenization and compression. In addition to compression, BPE can also be used for encryption purposes. By replacing frequently occurring character sequences with a new symbol, it can create an encryption scheme that is difficult for outsiders to decode. This is because the mapping of the original text to its encoded form changes with each iteration of the BPE algorithm, adding an element of randomness to the encryption. Additionally, since the compression is achieved by eliminating redundancy in the text, the resulting encoded text is often shorter, making it easier and faster to transmit over networks.
